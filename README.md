# Fake News Detection

This project aims to detect fake news articles using machine learning techniques. It analyzes textual content to determine the likelihood that an article contains false or misleading information.

## Dataset

The model is trained on a dataset of labeled news articles, where each article is labeled as either "fake" or "real". The dataset should ideally be balanced to prevent bias in the model's predictions.

## Features

- **Text Analysis**: The model analyzes various features of the text, including word frequency, sentiment, and linguistic patterns.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Several machine learning algorithms are explored for classification, such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or Support Vector Machines.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are used to evaluate the effectiveness of the models.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language used for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning library used for building and evaluating classification models.
- **Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)**: Library used for natural language processing tasks such as tokenization, stemming, and sentiment analysis.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation library used for handling datasets.
- **Matplotlib and Seaborn**: Visualization libraries used for data exploration and performance analysis.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python installed on your machine.
- Jupyter Notebook (optional) for exploring and running the code interactively.

### Usage
Preprocess the dataset: Preprocess the dataset by cleaning the text, removing stopwords, and transforming it into a format suitable for training machine learning models.
Train the models: Train different machine learning models using the preprocessed dataset and evaluate their performance using appropriate metrics.
Choose the best model: Select the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics and deploy it for real-world use.
